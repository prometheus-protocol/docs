The Prometheus Protocol is a vertically integrated stack where each layer builds upon the last, ensuring a secure and seamless flow from code submission to end-user interaction. This page provides a high-level overview of the core components and how they interact.

### Core Components

The protocol is composed of several key on-chain services working in concert to provide the pillars of identity, trust, and payments.

### Identity & Interaction Model

A critical concept in the Prometheus architecture is the distinction between two types of identity:

1.  **Protocol Participant Identity:** The identities of developers, auditors, and DAO members who build and govern the ecosystem.
2.  **End-User & Agent Identity:** The identities of the final consumers who interact with the services listed in the App Store.

#### 1. Protocol Participants (The "Supply Side")

Developers, auditors, and DAO members interact directly with the protocol's core services to perform governance and supply-chain functions.

- **Actions:** Submitting code, creating bounties, submitting attestations, and voting.
- **Identity:** These actions are authorized using the blockchain's native identity system (principals). Participants typically manage their identity using tools like the **Prometheus CLI**, which leverages this native identity for secure, on-chain operations.

This ensures that every critical action affecting the software supply chain is cryptographically signed and attributable to a specific on-chain identity.

#### 2. End-Users & Agents (The "Demand Side")

When an end-user or an AI agent wants to use a service from the App Store, they need a more user-friendly and standards-based way to authenticate. This is the role of the **Identity Provider**.

- **Actions:** Logging into a service, authorizing an agent, granting payment allowances.
- **Identity:** The protocol's on-chain **OAuth 2.1 server** provides this functionality. Service developers can integrate this provider to give their users a familiar, secure login experience and to enable programmatic, permissioned access for AI agents.

This creates a clear separation: native on-chain identity governs the protocol, while the standards-based OAuth provider secures the services running on top of it.
