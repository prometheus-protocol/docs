Welcome, security expert! This guide is for auditors and community members who form the human trust layer of the Prometheus Protocol. You are the gatekeepers of quality and security for the entire decentralized AI economy.

Your role is to review services submitted by developers, verify their integrity, and provide on-chain attestations of their quality. In return for your expertise, you earn rewards and build your on-chain reputation.

### The Core Mechanism: Reputation as Stake

Unlike traditional systems, you don't stake monetary assets to participate. Instead, you stake **Reputation Tokens**. These are non-transferable tokens you earn that represent your proven expertise in a specific domain (e.g., `security_v1`, `code_quality_v1`).

By staking your reputation, you are putting your professional credibility on the line, which creates a powerful, incentive-aligned system for ensuring high-quality audits.

### The Auditor Journey

This guide will walk you through the complete lifecycle of participating in the protocol.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Acquiring Reputation">
    To ensure a high-quality pool of auditors, the initial reputation is granted
    manually. Join our Discord, navigate to the `üéñÔ∏è-acquire-reputation` channel,
    and open a ticket to introduce yourself and state your intent. The team will
    review your request and grant you your first set of tokens to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finding Audits">
    Once you have your reputation tokens, browse the [Audit
    Hub](https://prometheusprotocol.org/audit-hub)‚Äîa real-time marketplace of
    services waiting for verification, each with a specific reward bounty.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claiming & Performing Audits">
    Stake your reputation tokens to claim an audit, perform your off-chain
    analysis, and submit your on-chain attestation directly through the web app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Managing Your Profile & Reputation">
    Track your reputation token balances, view your work history, and see how
    you rank on the community-wide leaderboard.
