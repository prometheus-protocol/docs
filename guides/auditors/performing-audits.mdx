When you find an open audit in the Hub that matches your skills, you can claim it. This reserves the work for you exclusively and guarantees you the reward if you complete it successfully and on time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Claim the Bounty">
    For any "Open" audit, there will be a clear **"Claim Bounty"** button. Clicking this begins the staking process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the Stake">
    A confirmation modal will appear, providing a final summary before you commit your stake. It will clearly state:
    - The bounty being claimed.
    - The required stake amount and the specific reputation token needed.
    - The time limit for completion (e.g., "72-hour lock").
    - Your available balance of that reputation token.

    <Warning>
      Once you confirm, your reputation tokens are staked and locked until the audit is completed or the time limit expires. You cannot get them back early.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Perform the Off-Chain Audit">
    After claiming, the audit's status will change to "Claimed by You" and a countdown timer will appear.

    The actual audit work is performed **off-chain**. You will use your standard toolkit to review the service's source code (linked from the audit page on GitHub), run tests, and identify any issues.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit Your On-Chain Attestation">
    Once your review is complete, you will return to the Audit Hub. On the audit's detail page, you will submit your findings. This is your **on-chain attestation**, which may include a score, a report, and a final pass/fail recommendation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Upon successful submission and subsequent DAO approval, the reward is transferred to your account, and your staked reputation tokens are returned.

After completing audits, you can track your earnings and reputation on your personal dashboard.
