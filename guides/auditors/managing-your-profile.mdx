Once you've logged in to the Prometheus Protocol, you can easily access your account information and track your reputation directly from the main navigation.

### The Account Menu

Instead of a separate dashboard page, all your key information is available in the account dropdown menu. By clicking on your profile icon in the top-right corner, you can open this menu for a quick summary of your status.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you'll find in the menu:

- **My Account:** This section displays your full Principal ID, which acts as your unique identifier across the protocol. You can easily copy it to your clipboard.

- **Balances:** This shows your current balance of liquid tokens, such as USDC, that are available in your connected wallet.

- **Reputation:** This is the core of your auditor profile. It provides a detailed list of the different types of reputation you hold (e.g., Build Reproducibility, App Info, Tool Details). The score next to each type reflects your level of expertise and is used to determine your eligibility for claiming specific audits.

This menu gives you a real-time, consolidated view of your assets and credentials within the Prometheus ecosystem.
