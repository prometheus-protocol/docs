The Prometheus Protocol provides transparent, on-chain tools for you to track your contributions, reputation, and rewards.

### Your Personal Dashboard

As a logged-in auditor, you have a personal dashboard that serves as your home base. It provides a complete overview of your activity and status within the ecosystem.

Your dashboard includes:

- **Reputation Balances:** A breakdown of all the different reputation tokens you own (e.g., "150,000 security_v1 Tokens").
- **Staking Overview:** A clear visualization of your "Available" vs. "Staked" token balances, so you know your capacity for taking on new work.
- **Active Audits:** A list of bounties you have currently claimed and are working on.
- **Completed Audits:** A historical log of all your successful audits and the rewards earned.

### The Public Leaderboard

To foster transparency and friendly competition, the protocol features a public leaderboard showcasing the top contributors across the entire ecosystem.

The leaderboard allows you to:

- **Track Your Rank:** Your own entry is highlighted, so you can easily see your position among your peers.
- **View Top Contributors:** See who the top-earning developers and auditors are.
- **Filter Results:** You can filter the leaderboard by role (e.g., "Auditors") and by time frame (e.g., "All-Time," "This Month") to get a more granular view of ecosystem activity.
