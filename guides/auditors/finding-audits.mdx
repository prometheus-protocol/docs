The Audit Hub is your central marketplace for work within the Prometheus ecosystem. It's a real-time, on-chain queue of all services that have been submitted by developers and are awaiting verification.

### Anatomy of an Audit Listing

Each item in the Audit Hub queue provides all the information you need to decide if you want to take on the job.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you'll see for each service:

- **Server Name:** The name of the service awaiting audit.
- **Audit Type:** The specific skill required for the audit. This corresponds to a specific Reputation Token (e.g., `security_v1`).
- **Reward:** The amount of reward tokens (e.g., preMCPT) you will earn for successfully completing the audit.
- **Required Stake:** The amount and type of Reputation Tokens you must stake to claim this audit (e.g., "Stake: 10,000 security_v1 Tokens").
- **Status:** The current state of the audit.
  - **Open:** The audit is available for any qualified auditor to claim.
  - **Claimed by [Principal]:** The audit has been reserved by another auditor.

You can browse this list to find work that matches your specific credentials and reward expectations.

Once you've found an audit you want to perform, the next step is to claim it by staking your reputation.
