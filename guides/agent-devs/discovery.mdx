---

The Prometheus App Store is your central hub for discovering services to integrate with your AI agent. But it's more than just a search engine; it's a transparent, on-chain registry that allows you to verify the security and quality of any service before you use it.

### From Discovery to Certificate

After browsing the **[App Store](https://prometheusprotocol.org/audit)** and clicking on a service, you'll land on its App Info page. The most important feature here is the **Prometheus Certificate**, which you can access by clicking the "view certificate" link under the verification badge.

This certificate is the immutable, on-chain proof of the service's quality and security.

### Anatomy of a Prometheus Certificate

The certificate page provides a detailed breakdown of the service's audit results. Let's break down what you're seeing.

When evaluating a certificate, focus on these key areas:

1.  **Verification Tier:**
    The badge at the top represents the service's overall level of trust, based on the audits it has passed.
    - **Gold:** The highest tier. The service has a reproducible build and has passed all declarative audits, including App Information, Tools & Dependencies, and Data Safety.
    - **Silver:** A high level of trust. The service has a reproducible build and has passed audits for App Information and Tools & Dependencies.
    - **Bronze:** The foundational tier of trust. The service has a reproducible build and has passed the App Information audit.
    - **Unranked:** The service has not yet passed the minimum audits required for a Bronze tier.

2.  **Audit Checklist:**
    This section shows the status of individual, declarative audits. A service must pass a specific combination of these to achieve a verification tier.
    - **Build Reproducibility:** Verifies that the deployed canister was built from the claimed source code. This is the cornerstone of on-chain trust and is required for any tier.
    - **App Information:** Confirms the accuracy of the app's name, description, and publisher details.
    - **Tools & Dependencies:** Verifies the tools, libraries, and dependencies used in the application.
    - **Data Safety:** Assesses how the application collects, uses, and shares user data.

3.  **Cryptographic Provenance:**
    This is the core of the on-chain trust. It provides a verifiable link between the source code, the compiled code, and the running service.
    - **Wasm Hash:** The unique cryptographic fingerprint of the compiled code that was audited and deployed.
    - **Git Commit:** The specific commit hash from the source code repository that corresponds to the deployed Wasm. You can click **"View Commit on GitHub"** to inspect the exact source code that was audited.
    - **Canister ID:** The on-chain address of the live, running service.

A strong Prometheus Certificate, with a high verification tier and complete provenance data, is your guarantee that the service you're about to use is exactly what it claims to be.

After you've discovered a service and verified its trustworthiness, the next step is to connect to it. If the service requires payment or authentication, you'll need to generate credentials to connect.
