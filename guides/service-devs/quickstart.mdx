This guide will walk you through the fastest way to get your new MCP server running on your local machine. By the end, you'll have a deployed, testable service.

We assume you have already created a project using `create-motoko-mcp-server`.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **DFX:** The DFINITY Canister SDK. [Installation Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/).
- **Node.js:** Version 18.0 or higher. [Download](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MOPS:** The Motoko Package Manager. [Installation Guide](https://mops.one/docs/install).

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the project's dependencies. The template uses both Node.js for scripting and MOPS for Motoko packages.

Run the following commands from your project's root directory:

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Motoko dependencies
npm run mops:install
```

### Step 2: Deploy Your Server

Next, you'll deploy the server to a local, simulated version of the blockchain network.

1.  **Start the Local Replica:**
    This command starts the local development network in the background.

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

2.  **Deploy to the Local Replica:**
    This command compiles your Motoko code and deploys it to the local network.

        <Info>
          You must run this command in a **new terminal window**, as the local
          replica will be running in your current one.
        </Info>

        ```bash
        npm run deploy
        ```

            After a moment, the CLI will output the canister ID of your deployed server. Keep this ID handy for the next step.

### Step 3: Test with the MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is a web-based tool for interacting with your server's tools.

1.  **Launch the Inspector:**
    This command starts the Inspector web app.

    ```bash
    npm run inspector
    ```

2.  **Connect to Your Server:**
    The Inspector needs the URL of your local server. Construct the URL using the canister ID from the `deploy` step.

    ```
    # Replace `your_canister_id` with the actual ID from the deploy output
    http://127.0.0.1:4943/mcp/?canisterId=your_canister_id
    ```

    Paste this URL into the Inspector's connection bar. You can now see and call the default `get_weather` tool.
