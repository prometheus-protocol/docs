Your service is deployed, monetized, and published in the App Store. Now what? This guide covers the common operational tasks you'll perform to manage your live service.

### Managing Your Treasury

If you've enabled monetization, your service's canister acts as a secure, on-chain treasury, collecting all funds paid by your users. The project template includes several built-in functions to manage these funds.

You can call these functions directly using the `dfx` command-line tool.

- **`get_owner()`**: View the principal that currently owns and controls the canister.
- **`set_owner(new_owner)`**: Transfer ownership of the canister to a new principal. (Owner only)
- **`get_treasury_balance(ledger_id)`**: Check the canister's balance of any ICRC-1 token.
- **`withdraw(ledger_id, amount, destination)`**: Withdraw funds from the treasury to any account. (Owner only)

#### Example: Checking Your Balance

To check your service's balance of a specific token, you need your service's canister ID and the token's ledger canister ID.

```bash
# Replace placeholders with your actual values
dfx canister call <your_service_canister_id> get_treasury_balance '(principal "<token_ledger_id>")'
```

#### Example: Withdrawing Funds

To withdraw funds, you'll also need the amount and the destination account.

```bash
# dfx canister call <canister_id> <method_name> '(arg1, arg2, ...)'
dfx canister call <your_service_canister_id> withdraw '(principal "<token_ledger_id>", 100_000_000, record { owner = principal "<destination_principal>"; subaccount = null })'
```

### Enabling Proof of Usage Rewards (Beacon)

You can participate in the protocol's rewards program by enabling the optional usage beacon. This allows your service to submit **Proof of Usage** data, making you eligible for ecosystem rewards.

**What data is collected?**
The beacon periodically sends aggregated, privacy-preserving usage metrics to a on-chain service. Specifically, it collects:

- Tool invocation counts
- Total token amounts processed by your tools

It is designed to be privacy-preserving and **does not** collect any sensitive user data, tool inputs, or IP addresses.

<Warning>
  **Prerequisite:** Your service's WASM must be verified and listed in the App
  Store for its beacon data to be accepted. This is a security measure to
  prevent abuse of the rewards system.
</Warning>

#### How to Enable the Beacon

Enabling the beacon requires a code change. Because the Prometheus Protocol manages all deployments to ensure code is verified, you must publish a new version of your service to activate it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Uncomment the Beacon Code">
    Open `src/main.mo` in your editor, find the beacon section, and uncomment the block of code that initializes the `beaconContext`.

    ```ts src/main.mo
    // --- OPT-IN: USAGE ANALYTICS (BEACON) ---
    let beaconContext = Beacon.init({
      // The Prometheus beacon canister ID
      beacon_canister = principal "g6mnv-haaaa-aaaai-q32wq-cai";
      // The interval between pings
      interval = 24 * 3_600_000_000_000; // 24 hours in nanoseconds
    });
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit the Changes">
    Save the file and commit the update to your Git repository. The publishing process is tied to your commit history.

    ```bash
    git add src/main.mo
    git commit -m "feat: enable usage beacon"
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish the New Version">
    You must now re-publish your service. This will submit your new code for verification and, once approved, the protocol will deploy it as a new version.

    Follow the same steps in the **[Publishing guide](/guides/service-devs/publishing)**, making sure to use your **new Git commit hash**. This ensures that the change is audited and transparently recorded on-chain.

  </Step>
</Steps>

Your server will now submit Proof of Usage data, making it eligible for reward programs once the new version is verified and deployed.
