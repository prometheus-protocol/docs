Once your service is built and tested, the final step is to publish it. This makes it discoverable in the Prometheus App Store and signals its quality to the world.

This guide will walk you through using the `app-store` CLI to get your service verified and deployed on the main network.

### The Verification Process

Publishing is a formal, on-chain process that gets your code from your machine to a live mainnet canister.

1.  **Publish:** You submit your service's Git commit hash and metadata to the protocol.
2.  **Build & Verify:** The protocol's automated system checks out your code, builds the WASM file, and verifies that its hash matches the one produced on your machine. This proves the source code is what you claim it is.
3.  **Deploy:** Once the build verification passes, the protocol automatically creates a new canister on your behalf and deploys the verified WASM to the main network.
4.  **Audits:** Independent auditors review your source code for quality and security. You can add bounties to incentivize faster reviews.

### Step 1: Get Your Git Commit Hash

The entire verification process is anchored to a specific Git commit. This ensures that the code being audited is exactly the code you intended to publish. Make sure all your changes are committed.

```bash
# This command gets the hash of your latest commit
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Copy this hash; you'll need it in a moment.

### Step 2: Find Your WASM Path

The publishing tool needs to know where your compiled canister WASM is located so it can hash it for verification. After running a local deploy (`npm run deploy`), you can find it at this path:

```
.dfx/local/canisters/<canister_name>/<canister_name>.wasm
```

For example, if your canister is named `my_mcp_server`, the path would be `.dfx/local/canisters/my_mcp_server/my_mcp_server.wasm`.

### Step 3: Initialize the App Store Configuration

The `app-store` CLI needs a configuration file to know what to submit. If you haven't already, initialize it.

```bash
npm run app-store init
```

This command creates a `prometheus.yml` file in your project root. Open this file and fill in the details about your service, such as its name and description.

### Step 4: Publish Your Service

Now, publish your service to the protocol. This single command bundles your code's proof (the commit hash and WASM hash), WASM, and your metadata, and submits it to the Audit Hub.

```bash
npm run app-store publish "0.1.0"
```

Replace `"0.1.0"` with your service's version number.

### Step 5: Monitor the Verification Status

Once you've published, your submission enters the audit queue. You can track its progress on the Prometheus Audit Hub.

1.  Go to **[https://prometheusprotocol.org/audit-hub](https://prometheusprotocol.org/audit-hub)**
2.  Click on the **"Pending Verifications"** tab.
3.  Find your service by its WASM hash.

Once complete, your MCP server will appear on the home page.

#### Speeding Up the Review

The audit is performed by other members of the ecosystem. To get your service reviewed faster, you can add a bounty to your submission.

- **Add a Bounty:** Use the app store UI to add a bounty to your pending audit, making it more attractive for reviewers.
- **Request a Bounty:** If you don't want to fund it yourself, you can post in our Discord and ask if another community member is willing to sponsor your review.

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** Your MCP server is a trusted, verified, and discoverable part of the Prometheus ecosystem.
