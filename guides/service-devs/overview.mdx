description: 'Your complete guide to building, monetizing, and verifying a service on the Prometheus Protocol.'
---

Welcome, service developer! This guide is your primary resource for building on the Prometheus Protocol. We assume you've started by scaffolding a new project with our `create-motoko-mcp-server` template.

This guide will walk you through the entire lifecycle of a service: from a local "Hello, World" to a monetized, globally-available application listed in the decentralized App Store.

### The Service Developer Journey

The path to launching a successful, trusted service on the protocol involves these key stages. This guide is structured to walk you through each one.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Quick Start">
    Deploy a basic, functional MCP server to your local environment in minutes
    and test it with the MCP Inspector.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Enable Monetization">
    Integrate our on-chain OAuth 2.1 provider and enable the token allowance
    system to add paid, protected tools to your service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Publish to the App Store">
    Submit your service for a decentralized audit. A successful verification
    earns you a **Prometheus Certificate**, a powerful signal of trust and
    security.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Manage Your Server">
    Learn how to manage your service post-launch, including withdrawing funds
    from your treasury and enabling usage analytics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Your Toolkit

Your project template comes pre-configured with two essential command-line tools, accessible via `npm run` scripts. It's critical to understand their distinct roles:

    icon="key">
    This tool manages your service's identity. You'll use it to register your
    service as a client with the Prometheus OAuth provider.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="The App Store CLI (`npm run app-store`)"
    href="/guides/service-devs/publishing-to-app-store"
    icon="store">
    This tool manages the trust and verification lifecycle. You'll use it to
    submit your service for auditing and publish new versions to the App Store.
  </Card>
