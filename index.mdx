description: 'The essential infrastructure for the open agentic economy, preventing walled gardens and ensuring verifiable trust.'

The coming AI agent economy faces a critical choice: will it be a series of closed, **"walled gardens"** controlled by Big Tech, or an open, innovative **"web of agents"**?

An open web is only possible if we solve the fundamental problem of trust and safety in a decentralized world.

**Prometheus Protocol is the solution.** We are the open-source, on-chain foundation for the three pillars of a trustworthy digital economy.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Verifiable Trust" icon="shield-check">
    An on-chain software supply chain that manages everything from a service's
    Git commit to its verified, on-chain deployment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure Identity" icon="key">
    A unified identity system supporting both interactive logins for humans and
    API keys for autonomous agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct Payments" icon="dollar-sign">
    An integrated token allowance system empowering users to grant services
    direct, metered access to funds for machine-to-machine commerce.

By combining these layers, Prometheus provides the foundational infrastructure for a new generation of decentralized applications and the emerging AI agent economy.

### Who is this for?

This documentation is for anyone building or interacting with the decentralized AI economy.

- **Service Developers:** Learn how to enable payments, get your code audited, and have it securely deployed by the protocol.
- **AI Agent Developers:** Discover how to find trusted services, generate API keys, and securely integrate them into your agents.
- **Auditors & Community Members:** Understand the on-chain audit process and your role in maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem.

### How These Docs Are Organized
