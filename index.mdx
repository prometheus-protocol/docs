## The Trust Layer for the AI Economy

As autonomous AI agents become more popular, they rely on a decentralized network of specialized services to perform their work. But this creates a fundamental problem: **how can an agent, or its owner, trust a third-party service?**

Prometheus Protocol provides the solution. We are building a complete, on-chain economic engine that provides a unified foundation for the three pillars of a trustworthy digital economy.

    A full-featured, on-chain **OAuth 2.1 provider** serves as the robust
    foundation for standards-based authentication.

    A high-assurance **App Store and Software Supply Chain Hub** combining a
    versioned registry, audit bounties, and on-chain endorsements.

  <Card title="Direct Payments" href="#" icon="dollar-sign">
    An integrated **token allowance system** empowers users to grant services
    direct, metered access to funds for machine-to-machine commerce.

By combining these layers, Prometheus provides the foundational infrastructure for a new generation of decentralized applications and the emerging AI agent economy.
