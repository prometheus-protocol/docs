The Prometheus Protocol provides two primary command-line tools for interacting with the ecosystem: the **App Store CLI** for managing the full application lifecycle, and the **Auth CLI** for managing OAuth client registration.

## The App Store CLI

The official CLI for developers, auditors, and DAO members. It handles everything from submitting an app for verification to performing audits and finalizing governance votes.

### Usage

The way you invoke the CLI depends on your role:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Developers">
    The CLI is included in projects created with `create-motoko-mcp-server`. You interact with it via `npm run` scripts. Note the required `--` to pass arguments.

    ```bash
    npm run app-store -- <command> [options]
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Auditors & DAO Members">
    As an external user, you should use `npx` to ensure you are always running the latest version.

    ```bash
    npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli <command> [options]
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Developer Commands

Commands for managing the application lifecycle from within your project.

#### `init`

Initializes a new `prometheus.yml` configuration file in the current directory. This file contains the metadata for your service.

```bash
npm run app-store init
```

#### `submit`

Submits your service's WASM hash and metadata for verification based on your `prometheus.yml` config. This creates an entry in the App Store and opens it up for auditing.

```bash
npm run app-store submit
```

#### `status`

Checks the current verification status of your application (e.g., Pending, Auditing, Verified, Rejected).

```bash
npm run app-store status
```

#### `publish`

Publishes a new, DAO-verified version of your application to the App Store, making it visible to end-users.

```bash
npm run app-store -- publish --app-version "1.0.0"
```

---

### Auditor & Bounty Commands

Commands for discovering, auditing, and claiming rewards.

#### `bounty list`

Lists all available bounties on the network, showing their status (Open, Reserved, or Claimed).

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli bounty list
```

#### `bounty reserve <bounty-id>`

Reserves an open bounty by staking your reputation tokens. This grants you an exclusive lock to perform the audit.

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli bounty reserve <bounty-id>
```

#### `bounty create`

Creates a new bounty to incentivize a specific audit for a WASM.

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli bounty create <amount> <token-canister-id> --wasm-id <id> --audit-type <type>
```

#### `bounty claim <bounty-id>`

Claims the reward for a reserved bounty after your corresponding attestation has been successfully submitted and approved.

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli bounty claim <bounty-id>
```

#### `attest generate`

Generates a template YAML file for a specific audit type (e.g., `security_v1`).

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli attest generate --type security_v1
```

#### `attest submit <file>`

Submits a completed attestation file for a bounty you have reserved.

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli attest submit attestation.yml --bounty-id <bounty_id>
```

---

### DAO Commands

Commands for governance and final verification.

#### `dao list`

Lists all WASM submissions that have new, unreviewed attestations awaiting a DAO vote.

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli dao list
```

#### `dao generate-ballot`

Generates a template YAML file for a DAO member to formalize their vote on a submission.

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli dao generate-ballot --wasm-id <wasm_id>
```

#### `dao finalize`

Submits a completed decision ballot file to finalize a submission's status (e.g., to `Verified` or `Rejected`).

```bash
npx @prometheus-protocol/app-store-cli dao finalize --file ballot.yml
```

---

## The Auth CLI

This tool manages your service's registration with the Prometheus OAuth provider. It is typically used via `npm run` scripts from within a service developer's project.

#### `register`

Interactively registers your service as a new OAuth client. It saves the output to `.auth_client.json`.

```bash
npm run auth register
```

#### `update`

Interactively updates an existing OAuth client registration. This is commonly used to change the redirect URI when moving from a local to a production environment.

```bash
npm run auth update
```

#### `list`

Lists all resource servers (OAuth clients) registered by your current identity.

```bash
npm run auth list
```

#### `delete`

Deletes an existing resource server registration.

```bash
npm run auth delete
```
