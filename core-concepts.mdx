The Prometheus Protocol is built on three interconnected pillars that work together to create a self-sustaining, trustworthy economic engine for the decentralized AI economy. Understanding these concepts is key to understanding the power of the entire ecosystem.

## 1. Secure Identity & Authorization

#### The Problem

For any economy to function, participants need a reliable way to identify themselves and authorize actions. How does a service know which user—or which AI agent—is making a request? How can a user grant permissions to an agent without handing over their primary credentials?

#### The Prometheus Solution

Prometheus provides a **unified identity model** built on the user's Principal ID. This single identity can be authenticated using two distinct, purpose-built methods:

- **API Keys:** Long-lived credentials designed for programmatic use by autonomous agents, scripts, and backend services.
- **OAuth 2.1 (JWTs):** A standards-based flow for interactive logins, allowing human users to securely connect to services through a familiar browser-based experience.

This dual approach ensures that both humans and machines can securely interact with services, while developers only need to integrate a single authentication context on their backend.

## 2. Verifiable Trust & Discovery

#### The Problem

The core challenge of a decentralized service economy is trust. How can you be sure a third-party service is secure, reliable, and that the code running on-chain is the same code that was audited?

#### The Prometheus Solution

We built an **on-chain software supply chain and App Store**. This is a transparent system that manages the entire lifecycle of a service, from source code to live deployment, verified at every step.

- **Git-Based Publishing:** Developers submit a Git commit hash, creating an undeniable link to their source code.
- **Automated Verification & Deployment:** The protocol automatically builds the code, verifies its hash, and—once audited—deploys it to a new canister. This guarantees that what was audited is what is running.
- **Tiered Audits:** A bounty system incentivizes independent auditors to review the code. Passing these audits earns the service a **Prometheus Certificate** with a Gold, Silver, or Bronze tier, providing a clear, on-chain signal of its quality and security.

## 3. Direct & Efficient Payments

#### The Problem

The emerging machine-to-machine economy will be driven by high-frequency micro-transactions. Traditional payment systems are too slow, expensive, and complex for this new paradigm.

#### The Prometheus Solution

Prometheus integrates a **direct token allowance system** that serves as a single payment pool for a user's identity.

- **Unified Allowance Pool:** A user grants a service a single, pre-approved spending allowance from their Principal.
- **Flexible Access:** Both API Key-authenticated agents and JWT-authenticated user sessions draw from this same allowance pool, simplifying fund management.
- **Low-Friction M2M Commerce:** This model is perfect for pay-as-you-go billing, enabling direct, programmable, and near-zero fee payments—the fuel for a truly autonomous economy.

## The Flywheel Effect

These three pillars are designed to reinforce each other. **Identity** enables secure **Payments**, and the **Trust** provided by the end-to-end verification process gives users the confidence to grant those payment allowances, driving economic activity for the entire ecosystem.
