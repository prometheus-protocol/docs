The Prometheus Protocol is built on three interconnected pillars that work together to create a self-sustaining, trustworthy economic engine for the decentralized AI economy. Understanding these concepts is key to understanding the power of the entire ecosystem.

## 1. Secure Identity & Authorization

#### The Problem

For any economy to function, participants need a reliable way to identify themselves and authorize actions. In the AI economy, this is even more critical. How does a service know which user—or which AI agent—is making a request? How can a user grant specific, limited permissions to an agent without handing over their primary credentials?

#### The Prometheus Solution

Prometheus provides a full-featured, on-chain **OAuth 2.1 provider**. This serves as a robust and universal foundation for identity across the entire ecosystem. By adhering to a globally recognized standard, we ensure seamless and secure integration for any application.

- **Standards-Based:** By implementing the OAuth 2.1 standard, developers can use familiar tools and libraries, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry.
- **Human & Machine Identity:** The system is designed from the ground up to handle authentication for human users and authorization for autonomous AI agents.
- **Granular Permissions:** Users can grant specific, revocable permissions (scopes) to services and agents, ensuring they remain in full control of their identity and assets.

## 2. Verifiable Trust & Discovery

#### The Problem

The core challenge of a decentralized service economy is trust. How can you be sure a third-party service is secure, reliable, and won't manipulate data or poison AI models? Without a unified trust layer, the AI economy becomes fragmented and risky.

#### The Prometheus Solution

We built a high-assurance **App Store and Software Supply Chain Hub**. This is more than just a list of services; it's a transparent, on-chain system for verifying software quality through economic incentives and community governance.

- **On-Chain Registry:** A single, verifiable source of truth for all registered services and their version history.
- **Audit Marketplace:** A bounty system that incentivizes independent security experts to audit services and submit their findings (attestations) on-chain.
- **The Prometheus Certificate:** Verified services receive an on-chain certificate, a powerful and visible signal of quality and security that users and agents can instantly recognize.
- **DAO Governance:** A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) provides the final human oversight, reviewing completed audits to grant the final verification.

## 3. Direct & Efficient Payments

#### The Problem

The emerging machine-to-machine economy will be driven by high-frequency micro-transactions. Traditional payment systems, with their high fees, slow settlement times, and reliance on intermediaries, are completely unsuitable for this new paradigm.

#### The Prometheus Solution

Prometheus integrates a **direct token allowance system**. This empowers users to grant services direct, metered access to their tokens, enabling a new wave of monetizable applications without the friction of traditional finance.

- **User-Controlled Allowances:** Instead of making a payment for every action, users grant a service a pre-approved "allowance" that it can draw from over time.
- **Metered Billing:** This system is perfect for pay-as-you-go models, where an AI agent might consume API credits or computational resources on a per-call basis.
- **Low-Friction M2M Commerce:** By removing intermediaries, we enable direct, programmable, and near-zero fee payments, providing the fuel for a truly autonomous economy.

### The Flywheel Effect

These three pillars are designed to reinforce each other. **Identity** enables secure **Payments**, and the **Trust** provided by the App Store gives users the confidence to grant those payment allowances, driving economic activity for the entire ecosystem.
